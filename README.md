# Atomistic Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on **Atomistic Simulation**, which focuses on simulating the behavior of atoms and molecules at the microscopic level. Atomistic simulations are powerful tools for predicting material properties and analyzing phenomena in areas such as physics, chemistry, and materials science. The **Jupyter Notebook** in this repository provides theoretical insights and practical examples to help users understand and apply atomistic simulations.

## Contents
1. `Atomistic Simulation.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial and simulation code.
2. `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the repository and usage instructions.

## Navigation
The following topics are covered in the notebook:
- **Introduction to Atomistic Simulation**: Basic principles and applications.
- **Molecular Dynamics**: Simulating atom movement using classical mechanics.
- **Potential Energy Calculations**: Explanation of energy potentials used in atomistic models.
- **Example Simulations**: Practical examples showcasing how atomistic simulations are applied to real-world problems.
- **Visualization of Atomic Structures**: Use of plots and graphs to represent atomic-level simulations.
